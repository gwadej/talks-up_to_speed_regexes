# Up to Speed Regexes

This [presentation](regex.html) is intended to be given to a group containing
unknown or mixed skill with regular expressions and bring them up to a
consistent level of experience relatively quickly. I don't expect everyone to
get the same level of expertise from one presentation.

My goal is that by the end, each member of the group will have been exposed
to enough of the concepts to be effective with this tool.
